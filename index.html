        <p><em><strong>English</strong> and <strong>Russian</strong> teacher, founder of <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/englishasawaytogrow/">English as a way to grow</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I’ve been giving one-to-one English lessons since 2011. In 2017 I started teaching Russian. I specialise in working with beginners who wish to speak Russian / English at a native-like level. I love helping students learn to pronounce
          sounds and
          make sentences using various grammar structures. My ultimate goal as a teacher is to help my students become independent non-native Russian / English speakers. Apart from giving one-to-one lessons, I help personal development fans learn to
          understand podcasts in English so they can improve their life on the go.</p>
